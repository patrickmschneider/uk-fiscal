# UK Fiscal Dashboard

A personal UK fiscal briefing dashboard for Patrick Schneider. The app has three tabs: fiscal balances and breakdowns; debt, financing operations and redemptions; and Pricing for nominal/real yield curves and RPI breakeven inflation. Charts include source notes, tables, CSV and SVG downloads.

## Hosted app

[Open the dashboard](https://patrickmschneider.github.io/uk-fiscal/). GitHub Pages serves the app over HTTPS; no login, backend or paid subscription is required. The app and data are public.

The **Publish dashboard** GitHub Actions workflow deploys pushes to `main` and checks official sources daily at 13:17 UTC (13:17 London winter / 14:17 summer; GitHub schedules may run late). For an immediate refresh, open the repository’s Actions tab, select that workflow, and choose **Run workflow** with refresh enabled. A source failure retains validated previous data, displays its failure status, and marks the run failed after deploying. Enable repository Actions notifications in your GitHub notification settings if you want failure emails. GitHub can disable schedules on inactive public repositories after 60 days; re-enable the workflow if that happens.

The DMO calendar/notices and OBR forecast vintage still require maintenance when new publications appear; the daily job does not eliminate the documented coverage gaps.

## Run locally

Requires Node.js 22.12+ (tested on 24) and npm.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open the local address printed by Vite. The included official-data snapshots let the app run immediately. The local address works on the computer running it. The hosted app works across devices.

## Refresh data

Requires Python 3.11+ (tested on 3.13).

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pipeline.refresh
```

Use `--group fiscal`, `--group composition`, `--group debt`, `--group forecast` or `--group curve` for an individual source group. `--offline` replays locally archived downloads; `--validate` checks saved data. A failed group keeps its last good dataset, records the failure and returns a nonzero exit code. Downloads and release vintages are retained in ignored `data/archive/`; back up that directory if you need those vintages. Compact normalized vintages and input-checksum metadata are also preserved on the remote `data-history` branch. Raw source downloads remain local.

The repository includes fitted Bank of England curve outputs for this non-commercial academic dashboard, under the owner’s explicit decision to proceed with attribution despite unresolved reuse wording. This is not a claim of Open Government Licence coverage or specific Bank permission. The app and exports credit the Bank and its stated Bloomberg/Tradeweb inputs, distinguish dashboard calculations and disclaim endorsement. Original downloaded workbooks remain local. Run `python -m pipeline.refresh --group curve` to update the saved curves.

## Current coverage

- ONS public sector finances through July 2026, with reconciled receipts, expenditure and borrowing; March 2026 OBR monthly borrowing forecast via ONS.
- HM Treasury PESA annual functional history, 2003-04–2025-26, plus the detailed five-year snapshot. Its TES denominator differs from the fiscal page's TME measure; the app shows the bridge.
- Compare budgets over time offers annual economic, functional and revenue breakdowns, two-year contribution tables, and an interest-paid/received bridge. Taxes and NICs are shown separately from total current receipts.
- DMO gilt stock dated 4 September 2026. Auction results include July 2025–June 2026 and selected later notices; July–August 2026 coverage is incomplete. The July–December financing calendar uses curated official notices and still needs source discovery when schedules change.
- Local Bank of England nominal and real spot curves and matched RPI breakevens through 7 September 2026. Pricing offers saved-date comparisons and changes in basis points. Breakevens include risk and liquidity premia; they are not pure inflation expectations.
- Fiscal headline/time-series flows can be shown in £bn or % of GDP. The denominator is the latest published four-quarter nominal GDP ending on/before each flow endpoint (at most two months earlier), with its date shown and exported. Monthly/YTD flows are not annualised; these dashboard ratios differ from official ONS fiscal ratios.

The app labels definitions, observation dates and partial coverage. Refreshing a curated DMO notice does not discover newly published notices. Machine-readable source mappings and reuse notes live in `catalogue/`.

## Checks

```sh
npm run build
npm test
source .venv/bin/activate
npm run test:data
npx playwright install chromium webkit
APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5173 npm run test:browser
```

Run the development server first and set `APP_URL` to its printed address. Browser checks cover both pages, mobile overflow, keyboard access, accessibility, URL state and exports.

Personal website integration remains outside scope.

## Archive and rollback

Every build preserves a checksummed bundle on `data-history` before deployment. `deployment.json` on the live site identifies its snapshot and application commit. Archives contain compressed normalized data and source-checksum metadata, not original source workbooks. Git history preserves previous `latest.json` pointers. The archive pointer describes the latest build attempt; the live `deployment.json` is authoritative for what actually deployed.

To rehearse recovery without touching the working app, clone the archive branch and restore into a temporary folder:

```sh
git clone --branch data-history --single-branch https://github.com/patrickmschneider/uk-fiscal.git /tmp/uk-fiscal-history
python -m pipeline.archive_history --destination /tmp/uk-fiscal-history --restore SNAPSHOT_ID --root /tmp/uk-fiscal-restore
```

The command verifies all six datasets and reports `requiredCodeSha`. For a production rollback, recover that application commit in an isolated checkout, restore the matching snapshot (use `--code-sha` to enforce the match), and run the build and tests. Commit the recovered code/data to `main` while preserving the publishing workflow; the normal push deploys that pair without refreshing it first. Avoid force-pushing.
